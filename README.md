# Stöd vid hantering av läkemedel

This is an exploration of creating a SPA based on the Region Skåne Figma file "Stöd vid hantering av läkemedel" which at the time of writing is available at
https://www.skane.se/om-region-skane/detta-gor-region-skane/varumarkesmanual/tillampningar/digitala-kanaler/#334334

The project is a frontend exercise using: Vite, React, Tailwind and Flowbite React

You can try out the code on your local dev machine by cloning the repo and running:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The API calls are mocked using MSW.

Note: This project is work in progress.
